GUIdock: Using Docker containers with a common graphics user interface to address the reproducibility of research
=======

This repository is inteded for the benchmark. For GUIdock, please check: [GUIdock Repository](http://github.com/biodepot/GUIdock)


GUIdock is a Docker Package containing the entire computational environment to run applications with a graphical user interface.  As a proof of concept, we focus on supporting Cytoscape, a Java-based standalone program with a graphical user interface for the visualization and analyses of gene networks in biology.  In addition to Cytoscape, our container includes R, Rserve, Bioconductor packages igraph, networkBMA and a Cytoscape app called CyNetworkBMA.  GUIdock contains the entire pipeline and all the tools (including Cytoscape that connects to preloaded RServe, a Bioconductor package called “networkBMA” and all its dependencies) to generate gene regulatory networks.
